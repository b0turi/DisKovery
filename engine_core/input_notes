File Structure of Control set:

name
inputs
default keyboard/mouse
default gamepad
custom keyboard/mouse
custom gamepad

Actual input names will be organized as follows:
Keyboard: K_[key]
Mouse: M_[index of button]
Gamepad: G_[B for Button or A for Axis][index]

Range (-1  to 1) - R
Range (0 to 1) - A (for Analog)
Binary - B

Modifiers:
R - Repeating (like holding down a letter on the keyboard and typing it a bunch of times, useful for menu scrolling)
S - State (continues to be registered until the key is released or the range value is 0, like a 'walk' button)
A - Action (only happens once and can't happen again until the button is released and pressed again, like a 'jump' button)

Mouse Position - P (either included or excluded from input list to determine if it should be tracked in this control set)

Selectable menu items will be added into a graph with a Up, Down, Left, and Right value for where the focus should go after that element if another element is selected
